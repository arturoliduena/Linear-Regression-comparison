Linear regression is a fundamental technique in predictive modeling, widely
used across various domains. In this research project, we undertake a com-
prehensive comparison of different linear regression algorithms. Firstly, we
delve into the definitions of these algorithms, understanding their underlying
principles and mathematical formulations. Subsequently, we implement these
algorithms to facilitate a detailed comparison across various metrics. Our com-
parative analysis encompasses several dimensions, including performance eval-
uation, computational time requirements, the number of hyperparameters in-
volved, computational costs, prediction accuracy, interpretability of results, and
the complexity of the model (reflected in the number of parameters). By rig-
orously evaluating these aspects, we aim to provide insights into the strengths
and weaknesses of each algorithm, aiding practitioners in selecting the most
suitable approach for their specific tasks. The findings of this study contribute
to enhancing our understanding of linear regression algorithms, providing valu-
able guidance for researchers and practitioners in the field of data mining and
predictive analytics.
